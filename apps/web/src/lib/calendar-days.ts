 * Whole calendar days from today to a date, in the reader's time zone: 0 on

 *
 * Five places counted milliseconds and rounded up (`Math.ceil`), which
 * answers another question: a deadline at 17:00 read "1 day left" on its own
 * morning, "Today!" only once it had passed (an opportunity closing today
 * read "Expired"), and a round closing on 26 November read "37 days" on 21
 * October. A date written without a time ("2026-11-11") is that day where
 * the reader is, not midnight in London.
